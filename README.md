# db_exporter
a simple 2 pages (html+php) script you can upload to any server to export all sql tables containing a keyword

first, enter your database connection info

then it will show you all the tables found for the associated keyword and offer you to export them to a file

to go around potential restrictions for file writing, we display the dump into a text area and let the user copy/paste and save to a file.
